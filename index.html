<!-- human, please read these comments -->

<!-- all the stuff below, until title, is standard things you can pretty much just copy and paste -->
<!-- without worrying too much about what it means-->

<!DOCTYPE html> <!-- this tells the computer that the document type is html -->
<!-- html is the language that web browsers speak -->
<!-- web browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox) read html files (text) and make them into fabulous websites with images, videos, etc. -->
<!-- our code says to the browser: "please interpret all of this stuff according to the html standards that we have agreed on globally" -->

<html lang="en"> 
    <!-- this "html tag": <html> tells the browser, the html code begins now -->
    <!-- lang="en" tells screen readers that the text on this webpage is in English -->

  <head> 
    <!-- this is the website "header", which includes metadata about the website, such as: -->

    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <!-- charset = "character set", this tells the browser to display all possible characters correctly on the page -->
    <!-- if not determined, results in gibberish on screen, eg. "hääyö" becomes "hÃ⁠¤Ã⁠¤yÃ⁠¶" -->

    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <!-- this tells the browser to adjust the content depending on the size of the "viewport" -->
    <!-- the viewport is basically the user's screen -->
    <!-- nowadays people will navigate websites on their phones or computers -->
    <!-- so it's important to adjust the website content accordingly -->

    <title>how to make a website</title>
    <!-- now the fun begins! -->
    <!-- whatever you write inside the title tag, ie. between <title></title> -->
    <!-- will appeare on the tab in your browser!-->

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css">
    <!-- here we link to a CSS "stylesheet", in which we can define fonts, colors, font size, etc. -->
    <!-- we can also define these things on a need-by-need basis, "inline" in the html code -->
    <!-- but sometimes, and often, it makes sense to define things for the whole website -->

    <!-- I am going to write some CSS here for my document: -->	
    <style>
        body {background-color: rgb(255, 189, 241);}
        p {font-size: 24px;}
      </style>

    <link rel="icon" href="img/favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon">
    <!-- here we define the "favicon", what a strange name -->
    <!-- this is one of my favorite parts about making a website -->
    <!-- you create a 32x32 PIXEL or 64x64 PIXEL image (VERY TINY) -->
    <!-- and then this image is displayed as a tiny icon in the tab, next to the website title -->

  </head>
  <!-- this, backslash before the tag name </>, tells the browser: "end of all the metadata things I wanted to tell you" -->

  <body>
    <!-- here begins the BODY of a website, this is all the CONTENT, the STUFF of the website, the meat and bones. -->
    <!-- in our case: images and text -->

        <p>
        <!-- this is a "p" tag, p is for "paragraph" -->
        <!-- any text we write will be displayed on the website -->
            This is a website about how to make a website.
        </p>
        <!-- must remember to close the p tag -->	

        <p>please click option+command+I (mac) or F12 or Control+Shift+I (windows/linux) on chrome for developer tools so you can read the source code.</p>
        
        <hr>

        <p>p, lower case, is for paragraph, the paragraph tag, a p. It is pronounced the same as pea 🫛.</p>

        <hr>

        <!-- now I will make small modifications to this "p"'s style: -->	
        <p style="font-size: 50px;">This is how you increase the font size of a pea 🫛.</p>
        <p style="color: seagreen;">This is how you add color to a pea 🫛.</p>
        <p style="font-size:36px; color: deeppink;">This is how you increase the font size and the color of a pea 🫛.</p>
        <p>This is how you <em>emphasize a pea</em> 🫛.</p>

        <p>The more I repeat pea 🫛, the stranger it begins to sound 🔊.</p>

        <hr>

        <p>I will now add an <em>image</em>:</p>

        <img style="width: 100%;" src="img/img1.jpg"></img>
        <!-- src tells the browser where to find the image -->
        <!-- img/ means that it is in the img folder -->
        <!-- and img1.jpg is the name of the file -->	
        <!--make the image take up 100% of the width of the screen-->
        <p><em>image of a sculpture by Veijo Rönkkönen</em>, photograph by Terhi Marttila</p>	

        <p>I want the <em>image</em> to be small: 50% of the width of the screen.</p>
        
        <img style="width: 50%;" src="img/img1.jpg"></img>
        <p><em>image of a sculpture by Veijo Rönkkönen</em>, photograph by Terhi Marttila</p>	

        <hr>

        <p>Now I am going to create a div - a content division element. I am going to make a div that has all my images.</p>
        
        <p>Now I am going to place the div so that it is perfectly centered on my page:</p>
        <div style="width: 80%; margin:auto;"> <!-- width: take up 80% of the html document width 
          margin: calculate the margin size accordingly, automatically -->
          <img style="width:100%;" src="img/img1.jpg"></img> 
          <!--and make the image width 100% of the width of the division element-->
          <p><em>image of a sculpture by Veijo Rönkkönen</em>, photograph by Terhi Marttila</p>

          <p>! This image works like <em>a link</em>, taking you to a webpage that tells all about the image:</p>  
          <a target="_blank" href="work/img1.html"><img style="width:100%;" src="img/img1.jpg"></img></a>         
          <!--and make the image width 100% of the width of the division element-->
          <p><em>image of a sculpture by Veijo Rönkkönen</em>, photograph by Terhi Marttila</p>	
        </div>

        <hr>
        <p>A list of websites written in html for you to explore. Copy and modify their source code:</p>
        <!-- the "a" tag means "anchor" - confusing, right? In early days of html and the internet, it meant that the text inside
        the tag was an anchor to another part of the html document, or to another page. 
        
        In the words of Tim Berners Lee, "inventor" of the internet:
        "I used the term "anchor" for the the thing -- document or part of document -- a link starts or ends on" (post on 
        X/Twitter on February 4th, 2020).

        So I can write: Click <a>here</> to go to another site. If the user clicks on "here", it will take them to another site.

        We tell the browser where to take the user by specifying the "href", the hypertext reference. This can be a website URL/address,
        but it can also be other things, such as a link to another section of the same page we are already on.

        I also specify: target="_blank;", this means that the link will open in a new browser tab.

      -->
